I'm a junior at Cornell University studying [applied engineering physics (AEP)](https://www.aep.cornell.edu/aep), with a focus on mechanical engineering. Outside of class I build mechatronic systems for the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://cornellrocketryteam.com/). I have a background in semiconductor metrology at [KLA](https://www.kla.com/) and the [Stanford Nanofabrication Facility](https://snf.stanford.edu/).

I love ultra running, cycling, skiing, and paddleboarding.
