I'm a sophmore at Cornell University studying [applied engineering physics](https://www.aep.cornell.edu/aep), with a focus on nanofabrication. Outside of class I build mechatronic systems for the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://cornellrocketryteam.com/).

I love ultra running, cycling, skiing, and anything to do with the outdoors.
