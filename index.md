I'm a junior at Cornell University studying [applied engineering physics](https://www.aep.cornell.edu/aep), with a focus on mechanical engineering. Outside of class I build mechatronic systems for the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://cornellrocketryteam.com/). I have a background working on semiconductor metrology systems at [KLA](https://www.kla.com/) and [Stanford Nanofabrication Facility](https://snf.stanford.edu/).

I love ultra running, cycling, skiing, and anything to do with the outdoors.
