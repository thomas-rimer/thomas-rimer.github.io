<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<p>Flew into Papeete from SFO, landed in the evening. Walked from the airport to the Intercontinental. Had dinner at the hotel restaurant.</p>

<h2 id="the-run">The Run</h2>

<p>Took a taxi from hotel to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FzsMxbTej9sbHq9u5">this</a> parking lot. It was very humid, and temperature rose from 80° in the morning well into the high 90s by the afternoon. The UV index was topped out.</p>

<p>The first 3.4 miles was just running up the dirt road to the start of the trail, which is next to the restaraunt O Belvédère.</p>

<p>I took the trail for ~6.7 miles up. The first ~4 were relatively tame, after which the trail climbed up onto a ~3-6 foot wide ridge with 1,000’ to 2,000’ drops on either side. Many sections had rope to hold on to in case you slipped.</p>

<p>4.4 miles into the trail (7.8 into the run) was Fare Mato, a very basic emergency shelter.</p>

<p>I turned around after I ran out of water. I stopped by O Belvédère on the way down to refill on water from their kitchen.</p>

<p>At this point, I was roughly 12 miles into the run. I did not have enough cash for a taxi back, so I made the decision to run back to the hotel. This was a mistake; in retrospect I should have called the hotel and gotten a taxi.</p>

<p>It was an additional 16 miles from the trail head back to the hotel. This was through urban Tahiti, running on sidewalks, through industrial parks, and at one point along a freeway. I was hit by a car while running in the suburbs. I stopped for apple juice at a gas station ~3 miles away from the hotel.</p>

<p>After getting back to the hotel I succumbed to heat stroke and was unable to move for several hours. I rested that evening before flying back the following afternoon.</p>

<p>The run came in at ~28 miles, with 5,200 feet of climbing. <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/8810775540">Strava</a></p>

<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I should have had the taxi drop me off at O Belvédère (the trail head), not the start of the dirt road</li>
  <li>Carry as much water as physically possible; despite having several liters it was not enough</li>
  <li>I should have stopped the run after reaching the end of the dirt trail. Running through Urban Tahiti was not enjoyable</li>
  <li>My legs had hundreds of cuts and gashes from thorns; wear long pants or be prepared for cuts from the bushes</li>
</ul>
